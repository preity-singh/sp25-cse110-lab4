3. var has a function-scope, unlike let and const which are block-scoped. This can cause unexpected behavior when it is used within blocks. Additionally, var allows redeclaration of the same variable. This can lead to accidental overwrites.

5. The code returns an error. result was declared with let inside the if statement. Since let is block-scoped, and Line 13 is outside the block, it can't access result.

6. The code returns an error since it never reaches line 9. Line 6 throws a runtime error since you can't reassign a const variable.
7. The code returns an error. Since result is declared with const inside the if block, it is not accessible at line 13 which is outside the block.
